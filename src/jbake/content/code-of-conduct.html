      <p>JConf Dominicana is a newborn Java Conference in Dominican Republic. We work for an inclusive event, with sessions comprising of different levels: beginner, intermediate and advanced.</p>
      <p>The conference offers a unique opportunity for professional networking and collaboration between developers, tech companies, and startups.</p>
      <p>We promote the open exchange of ideas and expression. But we expect all participants (including speakers, sponsors and volunteers) to follow our code of conduct.</p>

      <h2>Unacceptable Behavior</h2>
      <p>Our conference is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices.</p>
      <p>We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference without a refund at the discretion of the conference organizers.</p>
      <p>Harassment includes, but is not limited to:</p>
   <ul>
      <li>Verbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination related to gender, gender identity, and expression, sexual/relationship orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, rage, age, religion, or any other social conformity.</li>
      <li>Sexual images in public places.</li>
      <li>Deliberate intimidation, stalking or following.</li>
      <li>Harassing photography or recording.</li>
      <li>Sustained disruption of talks or other events.</li>
      <li>Inappropriate physical contact.</li>
      <li>Unwelcome sexual attention.</li>
      <li>Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.</li>
  </ul>

    <h2>Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior</h2>
    <p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organizers may take any action they deem appropriate depending on the circumstances, ranging from issuance of a warning to the offending individual to expulsion from the conference with no refund.</p>
<h2>Reporting</h2>
<p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns relating to harassment, please contact a member of conference staff immediately. Conference staff can be identified by t-shirts/staff badges onsite; and an organizer can be found at the event at any time.</p>
<p>If you do not feel comfortable talking to a staff member directly, you can also report harassment at info@jconfdominicana.org.</p>
<p>Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference. We value your attendance.</p>
<p>We expect participants to follow these rules at all conference venues and conference-related social events.</p>
