    "bio": "I'm a mobile developer passionate of building exciting things, always looking to improve myself and reach newer levels each time. Software development has been my day to day for the last 7+ years. I have been running an interesting career which I have learned a lot about how to do the things in. I work for X-Team as a Senior Android Developer.\r\n\r\nI love the nature and take advantage of my family roots coming from a small town so I go visit my family multiple times every year to enjoy the rivers, mountains, that perfect weather and the very welcoming and heartwarming people.\r\n\r\nI enjoy the music and sharing with my friends (I make great jokes tho). I also have an obsession of increasing my family's life quality, I'm in the quest of and almost everything in my life go around that.",
