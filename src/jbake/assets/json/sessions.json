When we search in Wikipedia, you might find the following definition:\n\nReactive programming combines functional programming, the observer pattern, and the iterable programming\n\n.It is correct but we did not find a more useful definition but let's make a simpler definition.\n\nReactive programming is about programming with data streams.\n\nMutiny is a new reactive programming library.\n\nProvides a simple but powerful asynchronous development model that allows you to create reactive applications.\n\nEasy to implement?\n\nThe API does not require much advanced knowledge. This should help design your logic.\n\nThere will be live code!",

Probably many, especially in terms of technology and infrastructure.\n\nIn this talk, we'll discuss our approaches to overcome challenges that could prevent us from reaching our goals to create a viable solution for our users. We'll focus on open source tools that help us achieve the following objectives:\n\n- Have a single source of truth for our environments to support our contingency plan.\n- Reduce developer onboarding overhead and increase productivity.\n- Leverage existing technologies to reduce time to market.\n- Increase value for our users by improving service reliability.\n- Support business objectives with metrics, analytics, and platform observability.\nI invite you to join my talk to help you streamline your process of creating complex enterprise applications.",
